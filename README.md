# Wind-Visualization
Matt Bonazzoli and Lawson Busch

A particle visualization of wind vectors over the United States.

Number of Particles: 10000
Particle Lifetime: 200
Step Size: 0.1

If the step size is decreased the particles with appear to move slowly because the vector amount being added in each iteration is going to be less. The opposite will happen if the step size is increased.
